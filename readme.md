# AudioGame Kit (AGK) for Python
Welcome to the AGK. The AGK aims to allow for audiogame creation using Python. This project allows for many possibilities. It includes all the kinds of scripts you'll need to make your life easier, from screen reader/SAPI speakking to window creation and handling, to full 3D sound support!

## Using

To use this, you must first install all the dependencies. To do this, navigate in command prompt to this directory and type:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will then be ready to go! The examples folder within this folder allows for you to get an idea of some of the scripts we have here.

## Warning

This is still in beta, so not everything is done. There still may be bugs.

## Untested things

* 3D sound support. While this has been partially tested, the audio world class has not.

## Credits
